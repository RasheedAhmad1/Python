    "# Abstraction\n",
    "We use Abstraction for hiding the internal details or implementations of a function and showing its functionalities only. This is similar to the way you know how to drive a car without knowing the background mechanism. Or you know how to turn on or off a light using a switch but you don’t know what is happening behind the socket.\n",

    "Any class with at least one abstract function is an abstract class. In order to create an abstraction class first, you need to import ABC class from [abc](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjrtMSbwsXrAhVIzzgGHVMwDlkQFjAAegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.python.org%2F3%2Flibrary%2Fabc.html&usg=AOvVaw0Tb8GVbHgscdgGVAJbUvLR) module.
