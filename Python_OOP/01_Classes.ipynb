    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), is all about creating “objects”. An object is a group of interrelated variables and functions. These variables are often referred to as properties of the object and functions are referred to as the behavior of the objects. These objects provide a better and clear structure for the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example- If we consider a dog as an object then its properties would be- his color, his breed, his name, his weight, etc. And his behavior/function would be walking, barking, playing, etc."
