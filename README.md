# Basic and Advanced - Python

### Data Types

### Variables
* Variable names are case sensitive
 - for example name and NAME are two different variable names
* Variable name cannot start with a number
 - 9name is a wrong variable name

#### Taking input from user

#### Arithmetic Operations

#### Order of Operation

## Intermediate and Advanced python

## All algorithms implemented in Python (for education)
These implementations are for learning purposes only. Therefore they may be less efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library.
